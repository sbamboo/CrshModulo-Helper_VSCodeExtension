# crshmodulo-helper-v1 README

Extension for helping with the development of crosshell-cmdlets.
Cmdlets gets passed a few pre-defined variables, but the python-debugger/extension can't see theese since they are runtime-enviroment defined. (Sent through globals)
Thus this extension tries to add in hover/completion data for various variables and objects.

**Enjoy!**
